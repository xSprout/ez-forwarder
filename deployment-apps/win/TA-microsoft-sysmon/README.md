# Using this TA

Configuration: Install TA via GUI on all search heads, install via your preferred method (manual or Deployment Server) on forwarders running on Windows that have Sysmon 3.1 or greater installed.

Ensure that you have at least version 6.2.0 universal forwarders to take advantage of Windows XML event log format.
  
Sysmon ProcessCreate events may pick up passwords in CommandLine and ParentCommandLine fields. Depending on organizational policy you may be required to mask passwords either at search time or prior to indexing. SEDCMD entries can be added to props.conf files on search heads or indexers to mask data in known positions of passwords. Note this contribution has not been widely tested and may require substantial additional configuration and tuning effort. Use at your own risk.

```
SEDCMD-pwd_rule1 = s/ -pw ([^\s\<])+/ -pw ***MASK***/g
```

# Support
This is a community supported TA. As such, post to answers.splunk.com and reference it. Someone should be with you shortly.

Pull requests via github are welcome!

# Recommended Configuration

We strongly recommend that you use the popular Sysmon configuration shared by SwiftOnSecurity as your starting point:

       https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config

# Previously Recommended Configuration
*3/16/2017* - The following configuration guidance was included historically
but should now be considered deprecated. We suggest instead that you use the 
SwiftOnSecurity configuration as a starting point, and tune it to meet your needs. 
You may choose to use elements of the legacy configuration below, particularly if 
you are interested in excluding common Splunk image/file names from creating Sysmon 
events. 

*NOTE:* If you choose to exclude certain events based on file name, please be aware 
that this could potentially be abused by an attacker to hide malicious activity by 
choosing an excluded name for their malware. If you are not willing to accept this 
risk, do not use the configuration below.

Sysmon is capable of delivering a large amount of events into your
Splunk instance. The following configuration, loaded into each
system running Sysmon 3.1 or greater, will reduce the amount of data considerably.
Special thanks go to Jeff Walzer from the University of Pittsburgh for
originally helping to test this (walzer@pitt.edu).

Load this via sysmon -c (filename) from an admin-level command prompt.
(after you have placed it in a text file). You may get some 
unusual errors - these are benign and can be ignored. Check the
filtering via a "sysmon -c" with no argument.

For additional Sysmon filtering, remove the entire ImageLoad section.
